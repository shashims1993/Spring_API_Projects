 * As in this assignment, we are working with creating RESTful web service, hence annotate
 * the class with @RestController annotation.A class annotated with @Controller annotation
 * has handler methods which returns a view. However, if we use @ResponseBody annotation along
 * with @Controller annotation, it will return the data directly in a serialized 
 * format. Starting from Spring 4 and above, we can use @RestController annotation which 
 * is equivalent to using @Controller and @ResposeBody annotation

	 * 
	 * 1. Send message to circle 
	 * 2. Send message to users
	 * 3. Retrieve message from users
	 * 4. Retrieve message from circles
	 * 5. Retrieve all tags
	 * 6. Retrieve messages containing a specific tag
	 * 7. Subscribe a user to stream containing a specific tag
	 * 8. Unsubscribe a user from a stream containing a specific tag
	 * 9. Retrieve the set of tags subscribed by a specific user
	 * 
	 * we must also ensure that only a user who is logged in should be able to perform the
	 * functionalities mentioned above.
